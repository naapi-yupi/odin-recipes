# odin-recipes
I hope you'll enjoy my simple recipe website here in Github!

You can view my live website at: https://naapi-yupi.github.io/odin-recipes/

I will be making a website composed of different recipes that you can cook on your kitchen.
I will be demonstrating a basic HTML with no CSS and JS. 
Thank you!
